### My hobbiesðŸ”­

I love to observe and monitor the night sky especially on full moon days (Astronomy would be my career if I didn't like programming so much)

I love old games and games in general, I'm an amateur video game collector currently expanding the collection

Photography has always called my attention the act of capturing a moment and bringing different feelings through photos is something that fascinates me, that's why in my free time I'm photographing random things even if it's with my cell phone.

I do not live without music.
If you find me walking down the street there's a 99% chance that I'm wearing headphones listening to music, for me photography is capturing a moment, music is what conveys the feeling regardless of what it is
