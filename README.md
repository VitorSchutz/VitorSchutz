### Hello WorldðŸ‘‹

I'm Vitor Schutz but here on the internet, you might know me as PixelNerd, I love programming and solving problems, I'm from Brazil and I have great experience with Game Development but currently I work as a Back-End Programmer in Python

### My workðŸ”§

Currently I'm making small programs in Python just to not lose practice but I'm looking for a Back-End job and I'm accepting proposals.

I've been in a Game Development Project in Game Maker for 2 years

### My hobbiesðŸ”­

I love to observe and monitor the night sky especially on full moon days (Astronomy would be my career if I didn't like programming so much)

I love old games and games in general, I'm an amateur video game collector currently expanding the collection

Photography has always called my attention the act of capturing a moment and bringing different feelings through photos is something that fascinates me, that's why in my free time I'm photographing random things even if it's with my cell phone.

I do not live without music.
If you find me walking down the street there's a 99% chance that I'm wearing headphones listening to music, for me photography is capturing a moment, music is what conveys the feeling regardless of what it is
