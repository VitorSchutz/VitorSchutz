### Hello WorldðŸ‘‹

I'm Vitor Schutz but here on the internet, you must know me as PixelNerd, I love programming and solving, I'm from Brazil and I'm practically an expert in Game Maker language and I intend to learn more about Python or Java Scripty.

### My workðŸ”§

I'm currently working on a game in Game maker 2 in the Adventure style and plan to launch it from steam soon (You can see My contributions to this project on my profile)

I also have a great experience with Game Maker Studio 2 I can make a style game The legend of zelda without any problem

I also worked a little as an "influencer" on Twitch for a year and some months I have some experience in the subject.

### My hobbiesðŸ”­

I love to watch and monitor the night sky especially on full moon days (Astronomy would be my career if I didn't love programming so much)

I love games and video games (I'm a game developer)

I also like anime and manga is not something that I love very much or something that I just like and think is cool.

### My opinion onlyðŸ’¬

For me, a workplace where people get along and talk and that have some common interests because a good team is a team that knows exactly what others are saying or quoting
